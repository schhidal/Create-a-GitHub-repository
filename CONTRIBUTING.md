Create a new file in your repository called CONTRIBUTING.md. You can do this by clicking on the "Add file" button in your repository and selecting "Create new file".
Start your CONTRIBUTING.md file with a brief introduction that explains the purpose of the file and how contributors can use it.
Provide clear instructions for how contributors can get started with contributing to your project. This might include steps for setting up a development environment, installing any necessary dependencies, and running tests.
Explain the types of contributions you are looking for and how contributors can get involved. This might include bug reports, feature requests, documentation updates, code contributions, or other types of contributions.
Set expectations for how contributions should be submitted. This might include guidelines for creating pull requests, formatting code, writing commit messages, and other best practices.
Provide information about how contributions will be reviewed and merged into the main codebase. This might include details about the code review process, how to handle conflicts or issues, and how frequently contributions will be merged.
Include a code of conduct that outlines acceptable behavior for contributors. This should be a separate file called CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
Once you have written your CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files, commit them to your repository and make sure they are visible to potential contributors.
Finally, encourage people to contribute to your project by linking to your CONTRIBUTING.md file in your project's README.md file and other relevant documentation.
